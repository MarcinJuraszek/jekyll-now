## [CloneExtensions .NET Framework cloning library](https://github.com/MarcinJuraszek/CloneExtensions)

CloneExtensions is .NET Framework library designed to perform fast deep object cloning. It uses reflection and Expression Trees to generate and compile all necessary cloning code at runtime when you use it for the first time. Additional flexibility gives you chance to perform more complicated cloning logic when it’s necessary.

It’s compiled as Portable Class Library and can be used with .NET Framework 4 and higher, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 8, Windows Store app (Windows 8) and higher.
