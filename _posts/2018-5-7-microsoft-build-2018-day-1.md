I'm attending Microsoft Build conference this year and I figured I'd share my perspective on all the things that were announced today as well as some thoughts on certain sessions I went to and the conference in general.

### First impression and Registration

First of all, the conference is just massive. There are about 6000 people attending + plenty of stuff to make it happen.
That's a lot of people and definitely the biggest conference I've even been to.

I decided to register pick my badge on Sunday and I have to say that was an excellent idea.
When I showed up this morning the lines for registration were just crazy.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yikes! In line for registration. Does this line ever end? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSBuild?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MSBuild</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MRjam?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MRjam</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ow8vSnlj9U">pic.twitter.com/Ow8vSnlj9U</a></p>&mdash; Sean Ong (@sean_ong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sean_ong/status/993510082380943361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

I'm glad I was able to skip all that and head over to see the Keynote.

## Satya's Keynote

Talking about the keynote, if you haven't seen it you should. It's available on [official Microsoft Build website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd0Rd8w3FZ0).

It started with some very interesting thoughts on Privacy (including GDPR), Security and Ethics.
I really liked considering Privacy to be a Human Right.
I also loved Satya saying "we should ask ourselves not only what computers can do but also what computers should do".
It's definitely every developer should keep in mind when writing software, not just AI.

Later on it was very interesting to see how much time during the keynote was dedicated to Intelligence.
I guess this whole "Intelligent Cloud, Intelligent Edge" thingy is not just words but actual commitment to products and services allowing people to do things much better, safer and in more efficient manner.

For a long time most of the devices required the data to be sent to the Cloud, where compute-intensive processing could be performed and results could be sent back to the user.
With IoT Edge most of the processing can happen on the devices themselves.
Running code closer to the data and where the action is happening definitely has potential to completely change the competitive landscape and enable a new set of scenarios.

From using AI-capable drones to inspect pipes and power grids to optimizing order fulfillment at Starbucks intelligent devices are becoming more and more how things get done.
I'm very happy to see Microsoft participating in that revolution.
And based on the little I know not just participating, but also leading the way in some aspects of that transformation.
## Scott's Keynote

After Satya's keynote (and some ) there was another part driven mostly by Scott Guthrie.
It showcased a bunch of new Azure capabilities as well as some developer experience improvements in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. There were two favorite moments in that keynote: Visual Studio Live Share and Scott Hanselman's microphone failure.

[Visual Studio Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/visual-studio-live-share) is a new capability allowing developers to participate in a shared coding sessions.
Each session allows for collaborative coding, debugging and more. It works between Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, across Windows and Mac.
Seeing how Visual Studio user can drive a debugging session on a remote machine running Visual Studio Code without cloning the underlying git repository was just great.
And things got even better from there.
The experience allows for the debugger, local server and terminal to be shared too!
And all that in a secured and intuitive fashion.
No surprise that part got the biggest applause throughout the entire keynotes block ...

Until Scott Hanselman started demoing Azure Dev Spaces (which btw is a great new feature) and suddenly his microphone stopped working.
The failure was quickly turned into a success when Scott Guthrie saved the day offering to "add some value" and act as a mic stand :D
You should definitely watch it if you haven't already:

There is also an extra part not captured in that tweet, so you should probably watch the entire thing on [official Microsoft Build website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build). The "Mic Fail of MSBuild 2018" starts at 2:28:55.

If you haven't seen the Keynote you should. It's available on [official Microsoft Build website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd0Rd8w3FZ0).
